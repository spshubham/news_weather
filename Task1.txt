1. Read 1 GB of the data in main memory and sort.
2. Write the sorted data to disk.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all of the data is in sorted 1 GB chunks (there are 10 GB / 1 GB = 10 chunks), which now need to be merged into one single output file.
4. Merge the chunks using heap sort(Min heap)
5. Take first elements of each chunks and put it in min heap, also put pointers of each element to track the elements
6. Take the first element from min heap and put it in output file
7. Repeat the step 5 and step 6 until all data is sorted
8. Print the output file


example:
suppose we have 3 chunks like
chunks1 = 2-5-6-9
chunks2 = 1-3-4-7
chunks3 = 4-8-10-11

All the first elements of each chunk inserted into the heap will contain 2-1-4.
Now we will get 1 as the first element from the heap. And that element is inserted into the output file.
as we got the first element from chunk2 so, We will move the pointer of chunk2 from 1 to 3 and the next set element will be 2-3-4
we repeat the same process till all the data in all chunks is traversed
